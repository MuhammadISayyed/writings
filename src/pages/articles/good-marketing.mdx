Imagine shopping for a new bespoke suit. You’d go through picking either Italian or English style, deciding on the color, material and fit. But ultimately the tailor is the one who could assimilate all of your choices to bring about a beautiful garment you may enjoy for many many years.

For such a reason, choosing the right tailor is paramount; hence, the need to answer: What makes a good tailor? Attention to details? Knowledge? Past clients? Emotional intelligence? Keeping up with trends? Committing to classic styles? The list goes on and on. And as you may’ve noticed, things get paradoxical, which makes it even harder to objectively classify a tailor as good or bad. To answer the question, a little bit of abstraction is needed.

The context in which your need for a new suit has developed dictates what makes a good tailor. In such a context there’ll be many factors, each with its own value that may sway you from a tailor to another. My guess is that the most important factor here is prolonged enjoyment. Think about it, no matter what other factors may exist, the more enjoyable the process of making the garment, then wearing it for many years, the better the tailor is.

You may go with the most skilled tailor, the trendy one, the classy one, but nothing makes him a good tailor unless his creation brings about joy and enjoyment for you by using it.

## Marketing’s First Principle

Almost in every industry there’s this thing without which a practitioner can’t claim being good: an industry’s first principle, something so essential to doing good work in it.

Now if you’re looking for a new marketer to join your team, what do you think makes a good one? I mean what is this one thing that’s so fundamental to the marketing craft without which the marketer is no good for you.

Things get tricky (and dull) here. Most marketing hirings mostly depend on unrelated factors, say complementary at best. Take FMCGs for example. They mostly hire from the same pool because they look for people with FMCG experience. This is the primary filtration criteria. How on earth would you know if a marketer is good or bad based on previously working in the same field or not?

But it’s not about that. It’s about playing it safe. You know the saying, nobody gets fired for hiring a caliber from the same industry. Or was it for buying IBM? Doesn’t matter. The hiring process may turn to be a status game. Hire the most good-looking, the one with most prestigious degree, they say.

Now marketing is all about results, right? WRONG. Anybody can achieve results. The blonde teenager on TikTok gets results. The dude on Twitch 24/7 gets results. Actually they’re so good at getting results that marketers’ job has turned into “collaborating” with promising creators to deliver the results they need.

What makes a good marketer isn’t prestige, expensive degrees (although education matters) or experience in the same industry. It’s the methodical pursuit of more.

Know your customers. Build something they desire. Price it intelligently. Distribute it widely. And advertise it creatively. This is what most people perceive as marketing. And it’s all about the attainment of more, better or higher.

Yet there’s a fundamental dilemma that has haunted marketers forever. Which kind of more is better for my business? Go all-in with performance marketing? Split it 60% brand 40% performance? (Long live Les Binet and Peter Field) DTC? Retail? Oh, hybrid?

See? it’s so fundamental to our craft.

A good marketer has the ability to methodically achieve more on all business verdicts consistently. A marketer’s toolkit varies from strategy formulation to tactical execution and analytical prowess, all for the sole goal of selling more to more customers at a higher margin for a long long long time.

## Complexity & The Pursuit of More

We live in a complex world. The mere fact that A may not lead to B transforms the narrative. At least it should. No marketer could guarantee results. And just because something has worked before, doesn’t mean it’d work now. Simply put, the ever-changing nature of markets dictates guarantees as a lie.

If we perceive marketing as a sprint, then a failed experiment means the marketer is inept. But if we perceive it as a marathon, with the end goal of achieving more on the long-term, then failing an experiment is just a step forward towards winning.

If you agree with me that marketing is a long-term game, then the really good marketers build great companies that live for centuries, but also have their own share of failures. Sure, the de facto example here (and almost in every other business topic) is Steve Jobs. Didn’t he develop a number of failed products? Absolutely. In his biography, written by Walter Isaacson, we saw that things weren’t always as aspirational as people would like to believe. Now one of the things that made him the legend he was is resilience, the ability to keep your shit together event at times of failure and turbulence.

In fact, failure is so essential to successful marketing so much that I can claim that if you don’t remember the last time you ran a thing that didn’t work the way you expect, you’re in so much risk that you’re not even aware of.

Causality is rarely obvious (or true). Short-term hits don’t mean long-term gains. It’s just the way things are.

To be clear, I’m not proposing a blind culture of testing anything and everything for the sake of it. I’ve been there, and it’s a compulsive insanity. No. I’m proposing a mindset shift, where a marketer’s aptness is assessed based on how good he is at building resilient entities that could go so far without being harmed by running a failed experiment or getting hit by the happenings of the market.

If you’re keen to learn more about what it means to work in a complex environment, I strongly recommend reading the work of Dave Snowden and JP Castlin.

## The eSOV of trends

Did you know that one of the reasons marketers generally aren’t taking seriously is their lack of mastering business fundamentals? We’re one of the least trained profession in the entire workforce. Now, whether training is essential or not is the debate theme of another time. But imagine this: Millions of untrained marketers are hold sway every couple of quarters by a new technology. They blindly follow it everywhere. Why? Well, many explanations, but I like this one:

Excess share of voice (eSOV) is a popular metric in media planning. The “excess” part shows you by how much your brand’s share voice exceeds its market share. The premise is pretty simple: The higher your eSOV, the bigger your brand growth.

Let’s apply this to marketing trends.

A marketer’s land, full of ignorance and void, has one voice prevailing: the voice of trends. It’s the real deal. One solution to all of their problems. No insecurities: everyone is doing AI. No blame: Business insider said programmatic is what marketers should focus on. No training needed: just spend your entire budget on TikTok and report causality. See?

Now, when a trend enters a land whose people, generally speaking, are that ignorant, that compulsive and that dreamy, its eSOV is beyond the roof. And it happens again and again. For the past 8 years I’ve seen it all over the place. From SEO to TikTok, the eSOV of a trend dictates where the money, attention and effort goes.

Riding on a trend is a marketer’s shortcut to fame and personal branding. Branding himself as what, may I ask? I have absolutely no idea. But it works wonders. Why? Well, because it’s easier to believe in trends than to understand reality as it is. Trend marketers depend on the laziness of the human mind more than the prowess of their abilities.

## About The Present

Well, let me wrap up with the thought that while good marketing is about more in the long term, it’s also about surviving and hopefully flourishing in the short term.

It’s all about being aware of the situation and setting the right expectations. Ugh, how dull of me to say such an obvious thing, I know. But it’s astonishingly ignored. When you understand that you can’t exploit a business opportunity unless you figure it out. And you can’t figure it out unless you go through the incredibly difficult task of untangling its complexity, only then we won’t feel the urge to mention such dull statement.

Keep it curious!
