        Hi there, I'm Muhammad Ibrahim, a marketer based in Cairo, Egypt. My marketing career
        started in 2015 as a seo specialist, then I wore many hats, as a marketing specialist,
        strategist and copywriter.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the process I learned that there's a value to being a generalist, mainly seeing the big
        picture that's rarely the center of attention, yet has the power of transforming your entire
        business, for better or worse.
